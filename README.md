## Key Features

### 1. **Robust Authentication with JWT**
Implement a registration and login system using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to secure API endpoints, with distinct roles for **freelancers** and **clients**.

### 2. **Advanced Profile Search**
Allows users to filter and search for freelancers based on **skills**, **ratings**, and **rates**. The search can be powered by **Elasticsearch** or a custom search system built with **NestJS**.

### 3. **Project Creation System**
Clients can **publish detailed projects**, while freelancers can **apply**. The platform features **dynamic forms** with advanced validations built in **React**.

### 4. **Real-Time Messaging**
Implement a real-time messaging system between users using **WebSockets** or the **Socket.IO** library in the backend, enabling direct communication throughout projects.

### 5. **Project Dashboard**
Each user has access to an admin panel where they can view the **status of their projects**, review the message history, and receive **notifications** about important changes.

### 6. **Reviews and Ratings**
Once a project is completed, both **clients and freelancers** can leave **reviews** and **ratings** for each other, fostering transparency and trust within the platform.

### 7. **Real-Time Notifications**
The platform sends **automated notifications** to keep users updated on project status, such as when a freelancer applies or when a client responds.

### 8. **Testing with Jest**
The project includes **unit** and **integration tests** for both the backend and frontend, using **Jest** to ensure the stability and functionality of workflows.

### 9. **API Documentation**
The API is fully documented using **Swagger** in **NestJS**, making it easier to maintain and expand the project in the future.

## Bonus Features
